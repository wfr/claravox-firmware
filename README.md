## Upstream changelog
### 1.0.2

- Express instrument MIDI input and output channels as absolute numbers instead
  of normalized across the full 14-bit resolution of NRPN 1026 and 1027.
- Pitch Antenna Mod to Wavescan Freq parameter now properly clamps to 0.1Hz and 200Hz instead of rolling over.
- Fixed MIDI Pitch Mode now uses the full 0-16383 range of bend values and
  sends RPN 0 Pitch Bend Sensitivity before any note on event.

### 1.0.1
- Initial Release
